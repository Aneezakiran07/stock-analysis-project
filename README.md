### Stock Analysis Project
## Stock Market Analysis Dashboard
This project is a Python-based dashboard that analyzes and visualizes stock market data. It uses libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and BeautifulSoup for data scraping, processing, and interactive visualization.

## About the Project
The core idea and structure of this project are based on publicly available tutorials and sample codes, which I adapted to build a working dashboard tailored to my learning goals.

## My Contributions
Rewrote and customized the Python code cells to understand and implement data scraping and analysis workflows.

Developed the interactive dashboard components using Plotly for visualizing stock trends.

Cleaned and processed the scraped data with Pandas and NumPy.

Added comments and explanations throughout the code to improve readability and learning value.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me deepen my skills in:

Web scraping data from the internet using BeautifulSoup

Data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas and NumPy

Creating interactive visualizations with Plotly

Managing data workflows in Jupyter Notebooks

Feel free to explore the code, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions!
